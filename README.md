# netmob-nomads
A distributed game, anyone-can-play, simulation game where one creates an AI that can buy and sell its way around the net.
The initial platform for netmob-nomads is Raspberry Pi Zero using mesh networking implemented in Elixir using Nerves (https://www.nerves-project.org/)
Each playing device may also access the internet when available to extend it's awareness outside of the mesh.
